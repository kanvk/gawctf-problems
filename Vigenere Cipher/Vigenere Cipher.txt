>> I opened my email and an odd email has come to my account from a person with the alias “james”. 
   He mentions a key, which he claims is his name, then left me this code: paiGLO{bx4mkn_ct1jxa3}...
   What could it possibly mean?

>> HINT 1: Why do all these ciphers sound like dressings to me…
>> HINT 2: Who is blaise?
>> HINT 3: This is just another common cipher
