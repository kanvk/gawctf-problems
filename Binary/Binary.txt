>> I looked outside the window today and saw a pigeon with a letter. 
   I grabbed the pigeon out of the sky and took a look at the letter, and the letter told me the following:
   01100111 01100001 01110111 01000011 01010100 01000110 01111011 01110011 01101101 00110100 
   01101100 01101100 01011111 01100010 01110010 00110100 01101001 01101110 01011111 01100010 
   00110001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01101001 01100101 01110011 01111101
   What could it possibly mean?
